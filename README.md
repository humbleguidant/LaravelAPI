# Laravel API
This is a RESTful API created in Laravel. It grabs data from another API in https://pipl.ir/. After grabbing the data, it stores it into a database table called 'people'. The 'people' table contains personal data such as blood type, age, and so on. This API can also display the 10 newest records from the 'people' table and display statistics on the total number of people in a country, the average age, and so on. To test this API, we must download Postman if you dont have it already. 

# Download Postman
Step 1. Go to https://www.postman.com/downloads/ and choose the desired platform among Mac, Windows or Linux. Click Download. <br /> <br />
